  # Noteblock Studio Music 
</p>

Hello! Welcome to my collection of Minecraft Noteblock Studio (NBS) files! Each song was made just from listening to the referenced tunes so some are not perfect. 
You are free to use them however you like, but please do not remove the credits written in the "Song Info."

## How Do I Open These Files?
Each song was made using a program called Open Note Block Studio. The application was originally created by [stuffbydavid](https://www.stuffbydavid.com/) and is now maintained and updated by OpenNBS.
You can download the updated application [here](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio).

## Where Can I Listen to These Songs Outside the Application?
Most of the songs have been uploaded onto my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNfCn2p2NpWCR0DskkvM8A). 
You can view them there to determine if they meet what you are looking for.
